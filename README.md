# Reactor Models
reactorModels contains Python code for simple modeling (1D or 0D) of reactive flows in reactors. The reactive flow may contain any number of species and reactions. The thermophysical properties are temperature dependent, so temperature effects can be considered in the simulations.
For now, it contains model for reactive flow in a **plug flow** reactor with specified heat flux on the walls. The adiabatic reactor can also be modeled when the heat flux is set to zero.
